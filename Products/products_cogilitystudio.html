   <h1>Cogility Studio</h1>
   <p class="white">Cogility is the unique provider of an integrated development environment that employs a fully instantiated model driven architecture (MDA) environment for creating complex, service oriented and event-driven composite applications that solve difficult problems. </p>   </div>
   <!-- CONTENT BEGIN -->
   <h2 class="blue_underline">The Cogility Studio Difference</h2>
   <p>The Cogility solution treats process execution, web service orchestration and data synchronization simultaneously. Cogility’s pre built environment supports horizontal process and data integration, cuts across all databases, and leverages existing “standards compliant” J2EE application server technologies. Cogility is cost effective, easy to support and can scale to support even the largest and most complex requirements</p>


<h2 class="blue_underline"> Diversity and Scalability are our Middle Names</h2>  
   <p>Cogility Studio is being utilized in the telecommunications, health care, financial, and defense industries. Cogility Studio allows one to create, modify and maintain very complex systems with much lower resource commitments. What makes Cogility Studio significantly different than other visual programming environments is that the models created by Cogility are directly executable. In other words, Cogility’s high-level UML based models are deployed to an executable platform with a single button “push” and are directly executed without further coding or translation. Without service interruption, modified or new modeling artifacts (objects) are “re-pushed” to execution creating a holistic lifecycle that reduces system development, maintenance and enhancement costs by at least 75% over the life of the application.</p>
 
<h2 class="blue_underline"> No Barriers with Cogility</h2>
 <p>Cogility’s innovative approach allows solutions to be rapidly prototyped using visual modeling techniques to create solutions that are extremely change-tolerant and highly responsive to the needs of the organization. Intense research and development efforts have gone into creating an environment that eliminates the technical barriers to entry for creating complete high performing solutions, thus ensuring that business needs-not the complexities of the technical platform-define the complexity of the solution.</p>
 <p>Cogility Studio changes the software development paradigm by allowing programmers to directly encode the business user’s requirements into a model, work can begin with minimal requirements. Cogility’s powerful and elegant multi-user modeling and deployment environment supports rapid and continuous changes, so development can be highly iterative since changes and modifications are made in the model and “pushed” to execution with almost no cost penalty.</p>
 <p>On top of the base Cogility Studio offering Cogility provides frameworks aimed at several verticals to further reduce the development effort for new projects. These frameworks provide an integrated web UI, basic abstractions for the vertical, and a set of standard processes that can be a starting point for a project while leveraging past project experience. All frameworks are tightly integrated into Cogility’s Modeler environment providing vertical specific consistency checks, visual treatment of key abstractions, and tailored modeling presentation for the vertical’s domain concepts.</p>

<p>In addition to Cogility’s industry leading tool set, their thought leadership in key projects and problem approaches has supported clients with critical consulting support on difficult problems. On larger projects Cogility chooses to partner with larger consulting organizations to meet customer needs while retaining a focus on solid proven products and frameworks that provide leverage, and allow addressing unprecedented systems needs.</p>
