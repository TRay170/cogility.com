<p> Q: Why should an organization use Cogility Studio?</p>
<p> A: Cogility Studio delivers a unique approach to enterprise-wide application integration and data management. 
Cogility Studio enables radical improvements in IT productivity and business agility while maximizing existing 
infrastructure investments. Cogility Studio brings together recent advances in critical technologies to provide a single
Integrated Development Environment for solving the on-going problem of large-scale enterprise application integration, driven by complex, 
customized executing business processes, while simultaneously providing state-of-the-art data management functionalit</p>
<p>Cogility Studio helps enterprises manage complex IT integration projects by enabling the design, automation, and analysisof processes, 
business intelligence, and reporting, providing the infrastructure necessary to support Business Process Management (BPM) and Business Activity Monitoring 
(BAM) functionality. Using our products, companies can optimize existing technologies, streamline the integration of new technologies, quickly understand 
and address business weaknesses, easily recognize and take advantage of new business opportunities, and significantly reducemaintenance and support costs.</p>
<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="doesitdo" /></a>
<p>Q: What does Cogility Studio do?</p>
<p>A: Cogility Studio is a tightly integrated development environment that allows its users to fully and completely define applications that are driven by customized
business processes that can incorporate and orchestrate logic from other sources, such as web services or existing applications. Cogility provides several unique innovations 
in BPM functionality. For example, we provide the ability to invoke other functionality and orchestrate its execution through simple extensions to the OMG's Unified Modeling
Language (UML). In addition, Cogility has developed unique ways to manage the handling of transactions and exceptions in complex processes using widely understood UML notation.
Cogility provides a unique capability to model complex processes using widely understood, standards-based notation that can satisfy the most demanding requirements for event-driven
process complexity, Service Oriented Architecture and mission-critical availability.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, users can implement sophisticated, standards-based data management capabilities that provide for real-time Business Activity Monitoring and interfaces to 
other business intelligence technology. Using standards from the OMG's Common Warehouse Meta-model (CWM) standard, Cogility Studio allows modelers to develop sophisticated hierarchical
data structures that represent the individual applications or domains participating in a process. This hierarchy culminates in a Master Information Model that is driven by the leaf-level
      data structures through a series of standards-based data transformations. The result is a powerful, yet simple way to define a real-time Business Activity Monitoring capability as well 
      as provide interfaces to other business intelligence tools and/or data warehouse capabilities.</p>

	<p>Cogility Studio is based on the OMG's MDA approach to developing applications. Cogility allows users to create complete and consistent application models at a high level of abstraction,
     separating the application definitions from the implementation details. These meta-models contain all the information necessary to "push" them into executables without having to further
      develop application source code, data-base schemas, web service interfaces and a variety of other necessary application "artifacts".</p>

	<p>Once a composite application has been fully described, Cogility Studio ensures that it is consistent and fully describes the necessary artifacts for the application reflected 
    in the model. Using sophisticated application and scaleable patterns developed over many years by Cogility's specialists, Cogility Studio will then "push" the model to executables
     by creating a platform-dependent set of executable elements. Cogility has chosen standard J2EE application servers as the vehicle for execution based on the wide acceptance and available
      of this technology and based on the increasing set of mission-critical features and capabilities that can be inherited by J2EE applications.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="includedproduct" /></a>

	<p>Q: What is included in the Cogility Studio product?</p>
	<p>A:  Cogility Studio has three modules: Cogility Modeler, Cogility Manager, and Cogility Insight.  Cogility Modeler is a multi-user environment
     where business services, business processes, application data structures and data transformations are specified. The resulting model is checked for
      internal consistency and converted into a running J2EE application for deployment. Cogility Manager is the runtime environment that supports the executable model
       deployed from the Modeler. The model deploys as a fully executable J2EE application with model-generated Enterprise Java Beans and Web Services and a JDBC compliant 
       model-generated repository for storing the process automation logic and any data related to the running processes. Cogility Insight provides Web-based status monitoring
        and reporting capability. Together, these three product modules can deliver full lifecycle support for the design, execution, and analysis of complex IT integration efforts.</p>
<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="benefits" /></a>
	<p>Q: Within our organization, who would benefit by using Cogility Studio?</p>

	<p>A: Cogility Modeler is a multi-user, multi-domain environment that enables users to collaborate and build an end-to-end view of an integrated enterprise. 
    Business analysts can define the business processes that drive the enterprise, while application experts define the data structures and transformations that 
    carry the process communications into and out of the business applications.</p>
	<p>System administrators can deploy and monitor the performance of the Manager module. Any stakeholders with appropriate permissions 
    can gain access to the status of running processes using our Web-based interface, Cogility Insight.  Think of Cogility Studio as a solution
     that employs a common language to facilitate open communication amongst various teams across the organization. This end-to-end approach enables 
     communication across teams, eliminating the errors that often occur when integration projects are successively modified and handed off to the next team.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="standards" /></a>
	<p>Q: What standards does Cogility Studio support?</p>
	<p>A: Cogility Studio is designed to be as "open" as possible. The entire lifecycle supported by our three-part architecture - 
    Cogility Modeler, Manager, and Insight - is built in compliance with the Object Management Group's (OMG) Model Driven Architecture (MDA).
     Cogility Modeler defines the Platform Independent Model (PIM) and then converts it into a Platform Dependent Model (PDM) that can be compiled
      and deployed into the runtime environment. The object data structures and behaviors use the commonly adopted Unified Modeling Language (UML).
       Data transformations between systems are specified following the OMG's Common Warehouse Meta model (CWM) standard. The design environment exploits
        relevant standards to provide a mature, robust, and easy to adopt feature set. Cogility Manager's environment supports deployment on J2EE compliant 
        application servers. It leverages the Java Messaging Services (JMS) for asynchronous communications. It supports SOAP over HTTP for access to
         Cogility deployed services, with full WSDL support. It supports the invocation of remote Web Services over the internet for orchestration. 
         Cogility Insight Web uses a Web based interface to monitor the details of model execution. Cogility Insight Operational Support tools allow direct
          interaction with the executing model in the J2EE environment for queries, reports and orchestration events.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="advantages" /></a>
	<p>Q: What are the advantages of object-oriented processes?</p>

	<p>A:   When processes are designed in the form of templates, a single diagram is required to show all of the steps in 
    the business process from start to finish. If you consider all of the alternative actions that might be taken and exceptions
     that need to be addressed as part of a "normal" business process, these templates can quickly become unmanageable. The business 
     logic is often duplicated in template after template making even slight modifications to frequently used procedures difficult to 
     locate and update. In an object-oriented approach, logic is specified only once in a unique location and tied to the object responsible
      for the action or activity. This makes the construction of complex business processes much easier to layout and review, as well as significantly 
      reducing associated maintenance. With object-oriented technology, the business logic of thousands of templates can frequently be collapsed down to
       a much smaller number of easily located and managed objects. The default business logic can be defined at a high level and inherited, 
       with variations in the logic handled by logic overrides in specialized subclasses. This allows processes to be dynamic, with the ability 
       to vary execution logic based on the recipient of a specific business event. This approach also provides enhanced reusability and simplifies
        application maintenance by isolating logic changes to specializations.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a><a name="masterinformationmodel" /></a>
	<p>Q: Why use a Master Information Model (MIM) to transform data between systems?</p>

	<p>A:   In many of today's integration solutions, point-to-point connections are used to pass data between systems. 
    With very small numbers of non-redundant systems this might make sense. Most businesses have many systems to integrate
     and they may even have multiple systems performing similar roles. </p>

	<p>For example, many companies have 50 or more systems just to support billing functions. Under these circumstances, 
    the number of point-to-point connections required to support all possible business scenarios grows to astronomic numbers. </p>

	<p>Cogility Studio uses a central information model as a common language to eliminate the large number of source and destination combinations 
    that must be supported. This solution only requires each system to transform data into and out of the common format of the MIM. Any system can
     initiate an event. The incoming message is first transformed into the common format and then into the destination system's format. This is a much
      smaller set of transformations to support, and yet it still supports complete freedom of data movement between systems. This approach also makes
       it much easier to add a new system into the mix, because this can be done in isolation. The new system does not have to learn about the different
        data structures embodied by all the other applications it might interact with.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="runtime" /></a>
	<p>Q: What items are generated to make the runtime integration work?</p>

	<p>A:   The models built in Cogility Modeler are converted into a J2EE compliant application consisting of fully functional Enterprise Java Beans
     and Web Services which are generated from the model. The model deployment also creates the JDBC compliant repository that supports the J2EE deployed
      elements..The database can persist any information that is relevant to process execution to enable stable, long-lived business transactions.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="technicaldetails" /></a>
	<p>Q: How do users specify technical details within Cogility Studio?</p>

	<p>A:   At the lowest level, there are three ways to specify technical details that will be executed within the runtime environment. 
     The first method is through a series of pre-defined attributes that have either a simple value or selection that is required to specify 
     the desired action. The second approach is to use the Cogility Studio scripting language. This language is an easy-to-learn and use extension
      to the UML standard Object Constraint Language (OCL). The scripting language allows a high level specification of required execution behavior.
       During runtime, these scripts are executed using an abstraction layer that works with the model metadata to convert the high level instructions 
       to ones that can be executed on the execution platform. The third approach is to embed Java code into the model by instantiating Java classes and
        invoking their methods, and pass in required parameters to ensure proper execution. The developer is free to choose the method that is most appropriate on a case by case basis.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="organization" /></a>
	<p>Q: Does Cogility Studio support the import of existing data models?</p>

	<p>A:   Cogility Studio supports XMI® (XML Metadata Interchange) formatted files for exchange of schema definitions with external applications.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="integrate" /></a>
	<p>Q: Does Cogility Studio integrate with existing Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs)?</p>

	<p>A:   Yes, existing EJBs can be invoked as part of the model in Cogility Studio.  During the design phase, users can specify the code 
    to be invoked as part of the running business processes. When the model is converted into its runtime format and then deployed, the exchange 
    of information between the Cogility Manager application and the previously defined EJBs will be fully automated.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="J2EE" /></a>
	<p>Q: How are models converted into J2EE applications?</p>

	<p>A:   As part of the development of Cogility Studio, we have developed a sophisticated map of generic business processes and data 
    structures onto the supported services of a J2EE application server-based integration. Full support is provided for transaction control,
     database and directory access, Java messaging, and even Web services communication. This fully automated procedure will convert any business model into an optimized integration architecture that fully exploits all of these services.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="processperformance" /></a>
	<p>Q: Where can users see process status and performance statistics?</p>

	<p>A:   Cogility Insight provides a Web-based interface to any desktop user that has access and permissions to the Web site.
     Administrators can decide for themselves if this information should be visible outside the enterprise firewall. In the event 
     that partial visibility is desired for certain individuals or groups, the environment supports user-level name and password protection.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="multiplework" /></a>
	<p>Q: Can multiple people work on same model at the same time?</p>

	<p>A:   Yes, Cogility Modeler supports true client-server, multi-user access with a fine-grained version assigning system built in. 
    This means that each individual's changes are made and tracked on an object-by-object basis.  This is vastly superior to file
     based systems that require an entire file to be locked. Change sets can be submitted at a time specified by the user for coordination
      with other developers that might be working on an overlapping portion of the model.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="multiplephases" id="multiplephases" /></a>
	<p>Q: Does Cogility Studio support work on multiple phases simultaneously?</p>

	<p>A:   Yes, Cogility Modeler has a multi-branch configuration management approach.  Users specify the branch and version of objects
     that they wish to work on when they log in. The environment will keep the various branches separate so that one group can work on today's
      tactical enhancements while another group is busy with next quarter's strategic initiatives.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="upgraded" /></a>
	<p>Q: When can the system be upgraded?</p>

	<p>A:   Models can be updated at any time. Cogility Manager supports multiple versions of the same model in deployment at the same time. 
     When a new version is ready for deployment, existing business processes might still be running on the integration server. Many systems would
      require that these processes be completed before an upgrade was possible. Using Cogility Studio, the new version of the model is deployed while
       the processes are still running.  As new orders are placed or customer issues are opened, they will be run under the new process definitions.
        At the same time, the older processes will complete under the old definitions to ensure compatibility.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="platforms" /></a>
	<p>Q: Which platforms does Cogility Studio run on?</p>

	<p>A:   The Cogility Studio is 100% pure Java and should support any environment that has a compatible virtual machine available
     for it. In-house, we develop and test on Linux, XP and Windows 2003 Server. The runtime environment is deployed onto J2EE compliant 
     application servers and will run on any environment in which these servers are supported. Cogility has been successfully deployed in a 
     headless mainframe environment on an IBM AS400 server under OS400, running IBM Web Sphere.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="appsupport" /></a>
	<p>Q: Which application servers does Cogility Studio support?</p>

	<p>A:   The platform is currently developed and tested on Web sphere. 6.1, Weblogic 9.X, and Oracle 10g application servers. </p>

	<p>Support for additional J2EE compliant application servers will be forthcoming.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="datasupport" /></a>
	<p>Q: Which databases does Cogility Studio support?</p>

	<p>A:   We support Oracle 9i and 10g, IBM DB2 v8.x, MS SQL Server 2000, and MySQL v4.1. The database access is through 
    the JDBC interface and is done automatically by Cogility without requiring the specification of JDBC code. Porting and testing 
    of additional database technologies is fairly simple, and will be performed on a customer-driven basis.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="messagingsupport" /></a>
	<p>Q: Which messaging technologies does Cogility Studio support?</p>

	<p>A:   Cogility Manager uses either JMS or Web Services to support incoming and outgoing messages. As a result, any vendor's messaging solution that can receive and send either of these formats will be compatible with our tools.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="backuprepo" /></a>
	<p>Q: How can the system back-up its repositories?</p>

	<p>A:   The data captured in the design repository is stored in a database that can be backed-up using standard methods and tools. 
    Similarly, the data required to support running processes is persisted into the runtime repository and can also be backed-up using 
    standard methods and tools. There isn't any memory-resident information that would need to be explicitly saved to recover the system
     in the event of a system crash or power outage.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="updatemodels" /></a>
	<p>Q: Who can update models?</p>

	<p>A:   The Cogility Modeler administrator can control who has access to the various portions of the model. Individual users 
    are assigned a name and password.  Additionally, users are assigned to groups. Permissions to various portions of the design environment
     can be controlled on a user or group basis to prevent unauthorized tampering with the model.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="modelstatus" /></a>
	<p>Q: Who can view model status?</p>

	<p>A:   The Cogility Insight administrator can assign name and password protection to the users that require access to this data. 
     Permissions can be assigned to limit access and global control can be exercised through the use of firewalls.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="peopleofcogility" /></a>
	<p>Q: Who are the people behind Cogility Software?</p>

	<p>A:   The Cogility Software team is made up of business integration and software development professionals who have been developing
     model-based solutions for integrated system specification over the last two decades. Our leadership team is comprised of both business
      consulting professionals and technology leadership, giving us the unique ability to understand your business challenges and produce 
      the most advanced technical solution for business integration available today.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="closestcompetitors" /></a>
	<p>Q: Who are Cogility Software's closest competitors and how are you different?</p>

	<p>A:   Although there are many companies claiming to address some of the issues Cogility Software solves, there is no single company that delivers
     the functionality provided by Cogility Studio. There are a number of data transformation tools and process automation tools on the market. In order
      to automate business functionality, you have to specify what information needs to be moved and in what format (information modeling and data transformation)
      , and what conditions need to exist or what steps should be followed to propagate and synchronize this information (business processes). By combining these
       two aspects of business automation into a single environment on top of a model-driven abstraction layer, Cogility Studio offers a new approach to business
       s integration that is easier to understand and develop. At the same time, Cogility Studio helps to reduce maintenance and support costs and simplify enhancements to systems in the future.</p>

<a href="#top">TOP</a> <a name="softwarecustomers" /></a>
	<p>Q: Who are Cogility Software's customers?</p>

	<p>A: Cogility Studio is designed to serve any organization, large or small, faced with integration challenges. Cogility Software
     is a new entity currently operating as a fully owned subsidiary of Ceira Technologies. We have been addressing business automation
      issues as Ceira Technologies within major corporations, including: Apria Healthcare, Ditech.com, GMAC, Polycom, and Wells Fargo.
